## Passing

The two starting forwards made the most key passes.
This means they were often dependent on each other for assisting with the final push.

The goalkeeper and defenders lead in progressive passing which would be expected considering the team’s style.

However, the midfielder Giorgi Kochorashvili had the highest number among all outfield players, highlighting his crucial role in distributing the ball forward.
