Georgia’s Giorgi Mamardashvili was the most effective shot-stopper of the tournament, conceding 4.1 less goals than expected.

Mamardashvili was comfortably ahead of the average result of other goalkeepers in most ball distribution metrics.

Mamardashvili’s defensive actions happened very close to the goal area on average. Only his Albanian counterpart had to show his occasional heroics farther back than that.

## Defending

The captain & center back Guram Kashia led the team in the combined number of tackles, blocks, interceptions and clearances.

Georgia was the team that tackled the most far back.
The average tackle occurred at around 22 yards from the goal, very close to the penalty area. 

## Passing
![pass_fig1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67b7069a-11c8-4653-8383-d39b32ecbbbb)
The two starting forwards made the most key passes.
This means they were often dependent on each other for assisting with the final push.

![pass_fig2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e2971f9-64bd-43ac-86d9-ad16d3811cda)
The goalkeeper and defenders lead in progressive passing which would be expected considering the team’s style.

However, the midfielder Giorgi Kochorashvili had the highest number among all outfield players, highlighting his crucial role in distributing the ball forward.

![pass_fig3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c817f16f-6b95-48d1-b7e9-f5f35a68edd9)
Short and medium-length passes were attempted much more often than long ones.
The team struggled to complete most of its long pass attempts.

---

![pass_fig4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9ed21f3-f22f-4dc3-b890-c4f9549d2c61)
Georgia was among the top 5 teams in terms of the share of progressive passes.

For most teams with a similar result, this meant covering less ground in total with passes.

## Shooting

Both Georgian goalscorers scored as many or more times than indicated by their xG.
Georges Mikautadze found the net 3 times while having an xG of 2.3, while Khvicha Kvaratskhelia scored once, just about the same as his xG. 

---

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e97aff8-ed1a-45b7-a3ac-1fd72fd30a1a)
It took Kvaratskhelia 5 shots to accumulate his 1 xG, while Mikautadze, taking into account the 2 penalty kicks, needed 4 shots for 2.3 xG.

---

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d99cc15e-980f-48a4-ba5a-a30e132d91b0)
Georgia’s shots came from just outside of the penalty area, a more or less average result. 
There seems to be no significant correlation between the teams who mostly shot from up close and the teams that scored the most (highest-scoring teams shown from highest to lowest).
